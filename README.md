# RESTAURANT-CLI-PROJECT

## Overview:

This is a simple Python project that simulates an online restaurant ordering system through a command-line interface (CLI). It allows customers to view the menu, add items to a shopping cart, enter a delivery address, checkout, and track delivery status. The project is built using Python and stores all data in JSON files instead of a database. It is divided into multiple modules for better organization and maintainability.
